## ABOUT ME

- 👋 Hi, I’m @IevaZemg, I am an aviation engineering student at the Kaunas University of Technology. I first learned about programming when I was in high school. Pascal was the very first language I encounter on my learning journey. Then C++ followed, even though I never fully committed to learning those languages thoroughly, I always had a great passion for programming itself. In the first year of university, I encountered MatLab. Learning this programming language boosted my curiosity. Now I am trying to learn Java so I could kick boost my career as a software developer.   
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Java and finding same minded individuals.
